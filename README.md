**Information architecture:**

Agrotourism is experiencing significant growth, yet the hotel industry as a whole remains fiercely competitive. Prospective guests frequently make spontaneous stay decisions and anticipate finding essential guidance online. The website is designed as a single-page. It opens with an expansive hero section, complete with intuitive navigation and a prominent call to action. Subsequently, there is a brief introduction that underscores the defined core values: family orientation, eco-friendliness, and year-round availability. The gallery showcases the array of attractions, succeeded by a comprehensive list of amenities. A substantial contact form, accompanied by a map and social media links, resides at the bottom of the page.

**Design:**

The primary colour is evocative of honey and organic eggs, aligning with the agro-farm's natural product offerings. The tone colour captures attention while maintaining a balanced presence. The "Kalam" typeface, despite its handwritten nature, remains highly legible and coherent. Photographs taken by me.
